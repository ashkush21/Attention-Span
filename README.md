* **This prototype uses pretrained model of OpenCV.js to recognize face in the camera frame.**
* **Follow the following steps to run the project:**
    * Open index.html file and then wait for the browser(preferably firefox) to ask camera and microphone permission.
    * Click allow and then wait for few seconds for the video to start playing automatically after detecting you face.

* The playback of the video is controlled by the presence of face in the camera frame.
* There are two graphs on the web page showing the time for which the user was attentive and another shows the noise level       around the user.
* When you click the stop button the attention percentage and the noise ratio is displayed.
